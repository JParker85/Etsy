The purpose of this project is to:

Take an array of Etsy item objects and render them with jQuery: https://api.etsy.com/v2/listings/active?api_key=2uuik3dy8g9pkgjcxda052l6&keywords=enter-search-here&includes=Images

Try to emulate the visual style of the item thumbnails that Etsy uses in their web interface, minus the sidebar, header, footer, nav, etc: https://www.etsy.com/search?q=puffins
